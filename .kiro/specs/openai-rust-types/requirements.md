# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Rust workspace that generates strongly-typed request and response structures for the OpenAI API using Progenitor. The workspace will contain multiple crates with a unified dependency management system, focusing purely on type generation from the OpenAPI specification to provide compile-time validation of API request and response structures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to research and optimize Progenitor configuration through iterative comparison with async-openai, so that I can achieve maximum compatibility with the established Rust OpenAI ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting API specifications THEN the system SHALL use Python scripts to extract specific endpoint sections from the complete OpenAPI YAML
2. WHEN starting research THEN the system SHALL create openai-chat-completions.yaml containing only chat completions request/response definitions
3. WHEN generating initial types THEN the system SHALL use Progenitor with default settings on the extracted chat completions specification
4. WHEN comparing implementations THEN the system SHALL analyze generated types against async-openai submodule types for chat completions
5. WHEN optimizing configuration THEN the system SHALL iteratively adjust Progenitor flags to achieve maximum similarity with async-openai types
6. WHEN expanding research THEN the system SHALL repeat the process with additional endpoints while preserving previous optimizations
7. IF sufficient similarity is achieved THEN the system SHALL document the final optimal Progenitor configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a well-structured Cargo workspace, so that I can manage multiple crates with unified dependency versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a Cargo workspace in the project root
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL define all dependencies in the workspace Cargo.toml
3. WHEN individual crates need dependencies THEN they SHALL use `workspace = true` in their Cargo.toml dependency sections
4. IF version consistency is required THEN all crates SHALL use the same library versions from the workspace

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OpenAI-specific code organized in a dedicated crate, so that I can maintain clear separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create an OpenAI crate in the `crates/openai` folder
2. WHEN generating types THEN the system SHALL place all OpenAI-related files within the OpenAI crate
3. WHEN accessing OpenAI functionality THEN the system SHALL expose generated types through the OpenAI crate's public API
4. IF additional OpenAI features are added THEN they SHALL be contained within the OpenAI crate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Progenitor for type generation with optimized configuration, so that I can generate Rust request and response types that are compatible with the async-openai ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating types THEN the system SHALL use Progenitor as the code generation tool with research-optimized configuration
2. WHEN processing the OpenAPI spec THEN the system SHALL generate request and response types only (no HTTP client code)
3. WHEN using the OpenAPI YAML THEN the system SHALL process the OpenAPI specification located in crates/openai/openapi.documented.yml
4. IF type generation is needed THEN the system SHALL produce strongly-typed Rust structures with serde serialization support matching async-openai patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want strongly-typed request structures for OpenAI API endpoints, so that I can catch API usage errors at compile time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports the library THEN the system SHALL provide typed structs for all major OpenAI API request types
2. WHEN a developer constructs a request struct THEN the system SHALL enforce required fields at compile time
3. WHEN a developer provides invalid field types THEN the system SHALL produce compile-time errors
4. IF a request struct is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want strongly-typed response structures for OpenAI API responses, so that I can safely access response data without runtime parsing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deserializing API responses THEN the system SHALL provide strongly-typed structs
2. WHEN response data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time guarantees about field availability
3. IF the API response format changes THEN the system SHALL handle backward compatibility gracefully through optional fields
4. WHEN optional fields are missing THEN the system SHALL represent them as Option types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want support for all major OpenAI API endpoints, so that I can use the generated types for comprehensive OpenAI integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide types for Chat Completions API endpoints
2. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide types for Embeddings API endpoints  
3. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide types for Images API endpoints
4. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide types for Audio API endpoints
5. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide types for Files API endpoints
6. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide types for Fine-tuning API endpoints

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want comprehensive documentation for generated types, so that I can understand how to use them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the library documentation THEN the system SHALL provide rustdoc comments for all public types
2. WHEN learning the library THEN the system SHALL include usage examples for serialization and deserialization
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation about type structure and field meanings
4. IF integration is needed THEN the system SHALL include examples of using types with popular HTTP clients

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want an xtask crate for workspace utilities, so that I can provide command-line tools for the workspace as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up tooling THEN the system SHALL create an xtask crate in the `crates/xtask` folder
2. WHEN workspace utilities are needed THEN the system SHALL implement them through the xtask crate
3. WHEN running workspace commands THEN the system SHALL provide access through `cargo xtask` commands
4. IF new workspace utilities are required THEN they SHALL be added to the xtask crate
